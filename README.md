# CoreyMS_Scraper

This project is based on the Python Tutorial: Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Requests from Corey Schafer youtube channel.
This project is about how to scrape websites using the BeautifulSoup library. BeautifulSoup is an excellent tool for parsing HTML code and grabbing exactly the information you need.
Here, I scraped the information listed on the CoreyMS.com website.
